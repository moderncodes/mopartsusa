MopartsUSA, born in 2013, was initially an experimental project exploring minimalistic web design principles. 
It was constructed with HTML5 markup language and CSS3 for stylingâ€”innovative but not yet standard technologies at the time. 
Now, a decade later, this project is due for a refresh, transitioning from an in-house server to a robust Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance.

The primary objective of this revision is to demonstrate the basic requirements needed to create a fully static, mobile-responsive, user-friendly website, all without leaning on any JavaScript-specific frameworks. 
This guide is designed as a resource for aspiring developers keen to explore the Rust language, providing an illustrative example rather than a comprehensive manual.

Here's what I'll be using:

1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Rust, known for its impressive performance and safety features, especially regarding safe concurrency, will be our choice for backend templating.
2. [Less](https://lesscss.org/) -  I will use Less, a dynamic preprocessor style sheet language, to extend the capabilities of CSS, facilitating more adaptable and maintainable stylesheets.
3. [vanilla-js](http://vanilla-js.com/) - To avoid heavy, vendor-specific JavaScript frameworks, I am turning to vanilla-js, lightweight and fast.
4. [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) - This API will empower us to personalize maps with our content and imagery, enabling the integration of interactive maps on our web pages.
5. [reCAPTCHA Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise) - I'll be using reCAPTCHA Enterprise to protect our website's email system from spam.
6. [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) - Serving as the reverse proxy, NGINX will manage our HTTP traffic, providing security, scalability, and routing functionality. Also using NGINX for serving static files.
7. [HTTP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) I'll include the HTTP/2 protocol for its benefits, such as multiplexing, server push, and header compression.
8. [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) Certbot will be used to obtain HTTPS certificates, securing encrypted communications.

## Google Cloud (Compute Engine)
- **Zone**: us-central1-a
- **Machine type**: e2-micro 0.25-2 vCPU 1 shared core, 1GB memory ~$8.11 per month
- **Server**: CentOS Stream 9 

While this tech stack might seem overkill for a small project like MopartsUSA, remember that the purpose is educational. 
This project is an opportunity to dive into the use of Rust and other technologies in a real-world scenario. 
You will have a better understanding of how these pieces fit together to build a responsive, user-friendly and fast website.
